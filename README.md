Path Studio is a lightweight, maker‑friendly application designed to help people create CNC and laser toolpaths with clarity and comfort. The goal is to build a tool that feels simple for beginners, yet powerful enough for advanced users who want precision and control.

Path Studio focuses on three things:

- **clean design**: an interface that stays out of the way and lets you focus on your work  
- **modular structure**: every part of the app is built to grow without becoming complicated  
- **accessibility for makers**: clear workflows, readable UI, and a smooth learning curve  
- **cross‑platform support**: built with Rust and Slint to run smoothly on Linux, Windows, and macOS

## **What Path Studio aims to solve**

Many CNC and laser tools feel heavy, confusing, or overloaded with features. Path Studio takes a different approach:

- **simple onboarding**  
- **clear toolpath creation**  
- **fast, native performance**  
- **a foundation that can expand over time**  

The long‑term vision is to create a tool that feels like home for makers — something you can open, understand, and use without frustration.

## **Current state**

Path Studio is in early development. The project currently includes:

- **a native Rust + Slint UI**  
- **a modular app structure**  
- **a clean foundation for future features**  
- **cross‑platform builds planned from the start**

## **Why this project exists**

Path Studio is built with a simple belief:  
**creative tools should feel good to use.**

The goal is to make CNC and laser workflows accessible to everyone — from hobbyists to professionals — without sacrificing clarity or power.
